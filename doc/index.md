## **Introduction**

**free-ran-ue** is an open source project developed by [Alonza0314](https://github.com/Alonza0314).

The primary goal of this project is to create a next-generation RAN/UE simulator for testing the [NR-DC (New Radio Dual Connectivity)](https://free5gc.org/blog/20250219/20250219/) feature in [free5GC](https://free5gc.org/).

A key technical innovation of free-ran-ue is the implementation of [userspace GTP-U](doc-design-document/01-userspace-gtp-u.md), replacing the traditional kernel-space GTP5G. This approach provides greater flexibility and control over GTP packet manipulation, making it easier to manage and customize data plane traffic.

## **Support Features**

- Fundamental support for UE registration and PDU session establishment in both control and data planes
- Advanced feature: Support for [NR-DC (New Radio Dual Connectivity)](https://free5gc.org/blog/20250219/20250219/), enabling simultaneous data plane connections across two gNBs
