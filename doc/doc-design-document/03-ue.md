# UE

> [!Note]
> UE acts as a terminal device, like a mobile phone or an IoT device.

## Architecture Overview

![free-ue](../image/free-ue.png)

## Basic Connections

### Connections

There will be two connections from UE to gNB:

- Control Plane: Used for signaling messages, authentication, and session management procedures.
- Data Plane: Used for user data transmission through established PDU sessions.

### Procedures

1. UE Registration: Initial registration procedure to attach UE to the 5G network.
2. PDU Session Establishment: Procedure to establish data sessions for user plane communication.

## GTP-U

In `free-ran-ue`, UE will not engage in any GTP procedures. All GTP procedures are handled at the gNB.
