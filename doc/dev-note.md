## 20250711 gh-page Deployment and Main Image

Today I have ChatGPT to generate an image for this project and use mkdocs to deploy a github page for presenting free-ran-ue.

## 20250710 UE Registration and Update Logger

I've done the UE registration NAS procedure and the corresponding NGAP action.

For the logger part, I updated the package: [logger-go](https://github.com/Alonza0314/logger-go) to v2.0.3. It can support multi-tags with seperate `LoggerInterface`. As a result, I need to update the log part in free-ran-ue. Now the logger used in this project is more convenient.

## 20250627 Remove Comment Line

Nothin important, just remove a comment line.

## 20250624 Cobra and Test and License

Make the start method encapsolate by cobra-cli. Also construct the unit test in build protocol-message.

The most important thing is set Apache-2.0 license for this project.

## 20250623 NGAP Setup

I've done the basic NGAP setup between gNB and core network.

What a nice start!

## 20250622 Basic Repo Setup

This is the first day of this repo. It would be a crazy idea to construct a new RAN and UE simulator.
But going to do is better than being afraid.

Just do it!
