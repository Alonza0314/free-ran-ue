# Static NR-DC

> [!Caution]
>
> 1. Do not start the Master-gNB and Secondary-gNB on the same machine, as this will cause a GTP port conflict.
> 2. Do not start the UE on the same machine as free5GC, as this will cause data plane forwarding failures.
>
> There are two options for deployment:
>
> - Use separate machines.
> - Use namespace separation. For details, please refer to [Quick Start](06-quickstart-static-nrdc.md).

## A. Prerequisites

- Golang:

    - free-ran-ue is built, tested and run with `go1.24.5 linux/amd64`
    - If Golang is not installed on your system, please execute the following commands:

        - Install Golang:

            ```bash
            wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
            sudo tar -C /usr/local -zxvf go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
            mkdir -p ~/go/{bin,pkg,src}
            # The following assume that your shell is bash:
            echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.bashrc
            echo 'export GOROOT=/usr/local/go' >> ~/.bashrc
            echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
            echo 'export GO111MODULE=auto' >> ~/.bashrc
            source ~/.bashrc
            ```

        - Check Installation. You should see the version information:

            ```bash
            go version
            ```

    - If another version of Golang is installed, please execute the following commands to replace it:

        ```bash
        sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
        wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
        sudo tar -C /usr/local -zxvf go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
        source $HOME/.bashrc
        go version
        ```

## B. Clone and Build free-ran-ue

- Clone

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alonza0314/free-ran-ue.git
    ```

- Build

    ```bash
    cd free-ran-ue
    make
    ```

    After building, a binary executable file will be generated in the `build` folder.

## C. Start gNBs

- Modify the configuration file for gNBs:

    The configuration `YAML` file template is located at:

    - `free-ran-ue/config/gnb-dc-static-master.yaml`
    - `free-ran-ue/config/gnb-dc-static-secondary.yaml`

    Ensure that the information matches your core network settings. For core network settings, please refer to: [Start free5GC](01-free5gc.md)

    Please also pay attention to the `xnIp` and `xnPort` field, as these will be used for the Xn-interface between the gNBs.

    Also noticed the fields `staticNrdc` that should be set as `true` for enabling static NR-DC.

- Start gNB:

    After configuring the `YAML` file, execute the binary in the `build` folder to start gNBs with the specified configuration file:

    - Master-gNB:

        ```bash
        ./build/free-ran-ue gnb -c config/gnb-dc-static-master.yaml
        ```

    - Secondary-gNB:

        ```bash
        ./build/free-ran-ue gnb -c config/gnb-dc-static-secondary.yaml
        ```

## D. Start UE

- Modify the configuration file for UE:

    The configuration `YAML` file template is located at `free-ran-ue/config/ue-dc-static.yaml`.

    Ensure that the information matches your web console settings, especially the `authenticationSubscription` section. For web console settings, please refer to: [Create Subscriber via Webconsole](https://free5gc.org/guide/Webconsole/Create-Subscriber-via-webconsole/)

    To test the dual connectivity feature, there should be at least one **flow rule** (e.g. `1.1.1.1/32`) configured under the subscriber.

    Pay attention to the `ueTunnelDevice` field, as this will be the name of the network interface created later. Also make sure the `nrdc` section is configure correctly.

- Start UE:

    After configuring the `YAML` file,execute the binary in the `build` folder to start UE with the specified configuration file:

    ```bash
    ./build/free-ran-ue ue -c config/ue-dc-static.yaml
    ```

## E. ICMP Test

After UE has started, a network interface will be available. Use `ifconfig` to check it:

```bash
ifconfig
```

Expected output included:

```bash
ueTun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.60.0.1  netmask 255.255.255.255  destination 10.60.0.1

        TX packets 3  bytes 144 (144.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

ICMP test with `ueTun0` via Master-gNB:

```bash
ping -I ueTun0 8.8.8.8 -c 5
```

Expected successful output:

```bash
